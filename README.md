# MyReads Project

This Project is the first, rated assignment of Udacity's [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

It implements an app for managing books in your personal book-shelf. You can move books to three different shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want To Read" and "Read". Additionally, books can be removed from the shelves all together.

On the second "search" page, it is possible to search for books and add the results to one of the shelves.
